## Wasting my youngest years in coding, management and learning 👋

# Who am I?

I am a trans woman, student of various bachelors degrees such as:
- Software development engineering
- Systems engineering
- Criminology and criminalistics

Graduated as a Software development engineer degree.

I have decided to keep my learning journey so someday I can work for the FBI in criminal profiling, and work for NASA in the ISS.

## why software engineering? 

Well, I learned a lot from Wozniak, Gates and Jobs... also from Hewlet and Packard biographies, and found out that I have this ease for learning about technology.

So, after careful consideration I decided to take a Technical bachelor in Computer science, so that was my first approach to software engineering. And there, I found out I could be someone of importance in technology segment.

So after finish my first Technical degree I decided I wanted to specialize in systems not only programming but system development, management and implementation.

So far, I have experience working for a wide range of industries like energy, utilities, banking, insurance, and GIS.

So, after considering giving up in Tech industry I decided that it was not the best decision, so I came back smarter, stronger, and way more free so I can give my 100% to this passion of mine.
